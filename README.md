LeagueBench
===========

Author: Matt Navarifar 

Description: This app is designed for the PC game League of Legends. This is a free application that will allow
users to customly create builds for champions and save those builds. 

GITHUB information: I did not create this repo at the conception of this application, however, I will have
substantial amounts of change in which you will see the rough design of features left to do, as well
as the scaling of features implemented before the code was placed on GitHub.
